# How to write good comments

## Source Code

Comments in the source code are important because they help other 
developers (and also future self) to understand the code more quickly. 
They serve as documentation and can make it much easier to maintain and extend
the code.

* Comments should be clear and precise to avoid misunderstandings
* Avoid unnecessary jargon and complex language
* Comment on what the code does and why it was done that way, not how the code
  solves the problem (this should be clear from the code itself)
* Use of JavaDoc

## Git Commit Messages

Git commit messages are important because they document the history of 
a project and help to track changes. Good commit messages facilitate collaboration 
within the team and support troubleshooting and code reviews.

* Again, comments should be clear and precise, and not use complex language
* Format / writing style should be relatively consistent
* Write summary in imperative form (command form)
* The summary should be descriptive and concise and clearly 
  state the main purpose of the commit
