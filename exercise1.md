This text is written in _italic_, and now in **bold**

<fieldset style="text-align: center;"> You can also use some HTML- and CSS-tags in your 
Markdown-Sheet, to make your Markdown-Sheet even fancier</fieldset>

**To separate phrases it is important to have two newlines between phrases**

>This paragraph is only 
>separated with one newline
>
>This paragraph is... 
>
>separated with two (could be even more) newlines

So you can write tons of notes in each line, 
and Markdown won't separate 
these line without an empty newline.

Hopefully this is a helpful cheat sheet for Markdown!
